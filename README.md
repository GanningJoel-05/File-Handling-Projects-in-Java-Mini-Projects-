# Java File Handling Mini Projects 📂

Welcome to my curated collection of **Java File Handling Mini Projects**! This repository showcases hands-on implementations of core file operations in Java—from basic read/write to structured logging and beyond.

Each project is designed to reinforce concepts like:
- `FileReader`, `FileWriter`, `BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter`
- File creation, deletion, and manipulation
- Exception handling and resource management
- Real-world use cases like logging, data parsing, and file-based storage

## 🎯 Purpose

This repo is part of my backend development journey, where I'm:
- Strengthening my understanding of Java I/O
- Practicing clean code and modular design
- Preparing for real-world backend scenarios
- Building portfolio-ready mini projects
